Thus says the Lord God to Edom: “I heard a report from the Lord, and He sent out a message to the nations, saying, ‘Arise, and let us rise up against her for battle.’Behold, I have made you least among the nations; you are greatly dishonored.The arrogance of your heart exalts you, dwelling as you do in the clefts of the rocks, as one overconfident in his habitation, saying in his heart, ‘Who will bring me down to the ground?’ If you should ascend as the eagle, and if you should make your nest amongst the stars, from there I shall bring you down,” says the Lord.“If thieves come upon you or robbers by night, then to what place will you escape? Will they not steal a considerable amount for themselves? And surely if grape-gatherers come to you, will they not leave a gleaning?How Esau has been searched out, and his hidden things seized!All your allies force you to your borders. Men at peace with you oppose you and prevail against you. They set an ambush below you; there is no understanding in them.",
