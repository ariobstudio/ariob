            "So it came about that when I, Daniel, saw the vision and sought to understand it, then, behold, the vision of a man stood before me.I heard the voice of this man in the midst of the Ulai, and he called and said, “Gabriel, cause that man to understand the vision.” Thus he came and stood near where I was standing; and when he came, I was astonished and fell on my face. Then he said to me, “Understand, son of man, for the vision is yet for the end of time.” Now when he spoke with me, I fell on my face to the ground, but he touched me and stood me on my feet.Then he said, “Behold, I will make known to you what shall take place in the last time of wrath, for the vision is yet for the end of time.The ram you saw with its horns is the king of the Medes and Persians.The male goat is the king of the Greeks, and the great horn between its eyes is the first king.When that horn is broken and four horns stand under it, four kings from that nation shall arise, but not with its might."
