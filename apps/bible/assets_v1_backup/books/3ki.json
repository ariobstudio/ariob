His sickness was so serious there was no breath left in him.So she said to Elijah, “What have I to do with you, O man of God? You came to me to bring my sin to remembrance and to kill my son.” But Elijah said to her, “Give me your son.” So he took him out of her arms and carried him to the upper room where he was staying, and laid him on his bed.Then Elijah cried out to the Lord and said, “Woe is me, O Lord! The witness of the widow with whom I lodge, you have embittered her by killing her son.”Then he stretched himself out on the child three times, and called on the Lord and said, “O Lord my God, let the soul of this child come back to him.”So it happened, and the child cried out.He took the child and brought him down from the upper room of the house, and gave him to his mother. Elijah said, “Behold, your son lives.” Then the woman said to Elijah, “Now I know that you are a man of God, and the word of the Lord in your mouth is the truth.”",
