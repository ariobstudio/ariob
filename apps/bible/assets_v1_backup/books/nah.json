Trample the clay and tread it with straw; make it stronger than brick.There the fire will devour you, and the sword will utterly destroy you. It will devour you as a locust, and you will be oppressed as a locust.You have multiplied your commerce beyond the stars of heaven; the locust has attacked and flown away.As a grasshopper, your crowd of half-breeds has suddenly left, as a locust perched on a hedge on a frosty morning; the sun rises and it flies away. It does not know its place. Woe to them!Your shepherds slumber; the king of Assyria put your nobles to rest; your people departed to the mountains, and there was no one expecting them.There is no healing your destruction. Your wound is festering. All those hearing the news of you shall clap their hands over you, for upon whom has not your wickedness passed continually?",
