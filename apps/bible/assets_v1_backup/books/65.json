Nonetheless, the bishopric is a specific office both in the New Testament and in the early Church. The Twelve were the first to hold this office (in A", {"text": "cts 1:20", "cross_ref": "r3904"}, " “office” could literally be translated “bishopric”) and they in turn consecrated other bishops to follow them. For example, Timothy and Titus are clearly of a separate order from that of elder (see 1", {"text": "Ti 5:17–22", "cross_ref": "r11955"}, "; ", {"text": "Tts 1:5", "cross_ref": "r10664"}, ").

He is an icon of Jesus Christ, “the Shepherd and Overseer [lit., bishop] of your souls” (1", {"text": "Pt 2:25", "cross_ref": "r1145"}, "). Church leadership does not consist of one or more of the orders functioning without the others.
