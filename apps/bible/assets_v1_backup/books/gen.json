Then he went into his inner chamber and wept there.He then washed his face and came out; and he composed himself, and said, “Serve the bread.” So they set him a place by himself, and them by themselves, and the Egyptians who ate with him by themselves; because the Egyptians could not eat food with the Hebrews, for that is an abomination to the Egyptians.Now they sat before him, the firstborn according to his birthright and the youngest according to his youth; and the men looked in astonishment at one another.Then he took servings to them from before him, but Benjamin's serving was five times as much as any of theirs.
