They forsook the Lord; they provoked to anger the Holy One of Israel.Why should you still be struck as you continue in lawlessness? The whole head is in pain, and the whole heart in sadness.From the feet all the way to the head, there is no soundness in them, only wounds and bruises and festering sores. They have not been closed or bandaged, or soothed with ointment.Your land is desolate; your cities are burned with fire. Strangers take over your land in your presence and it is made desolate, overthrown by foreign people.So the daughter of Zion is forsaken, like a tent in a vineyard, like a hut in a garden of cucumbers, like a besieged city.Unless the Lord of hosts had left us a seed, we would have become like Sodom and been made like Gomorrah.",

It went away and departed from me like one who takes down a tent. My breath became in me like the web of a weaver when she draws near to cut it.On that day I was given as to a lion until morning. So He broke my bones, for from day until night I was given over.Like a swallow, so shall I cry; I will mourn like a dove. My eyes fail from looking to the height of heaven toward the Lord, who delivered me and removed the pain of my soul.O Lord, it was told You concerning this, and You revived my breath; and I was comforted and lived.For You chose my soul that it should not perish, and You cast all my sins behind me.For those in Hades shall not praise You, neither will the dead bless You; nor shall those in Hades hope for Your mercy.The living shall praise You as I do. For from this day forward, I shall cause children to declare Your righteousness, O Lord of my salvation, and I shall not cease to bless You with the psaltery all the days of my life before the house of God.”",

            "The prayer of Hezekiah king of Judah when he was sick and recovered from his sickness: “I said at the end of my days near the gates of Hades, ‘I shall leave behind the remainder of my years.’ I said, ‘I shall no longer see the salvation of my God upon the earth; I shall no longer see a man among my kindred.’ I left behind what remained of my life. It went away and departed from me like one who takes down a tent. My breath became in me like the web of a weaver when she draws near to cut it.On that day I was given as to a lion until morning. So He broke my bones, for from day until night I was given over.Like a swallow, so shall I cry; I will mourn like a dove. My eyes fail from looking to the height of heaven toward the Lord, who delivered me and removed the pain of my soul.O Lord, it was told You concerning this, and You revived my breath; and I was comforted and lived.For You chose my soul that it should not perish, and You cast all my sins behind me.For those in Hades shall not praise You, neither will the dead bless You; nor shall those in Hades hope for Your mercy.The living shall praise You as I do. For from this day forward, I shall cause children to declare Your righteousness, O Lord of my salvation, and I shall not cease to bless You with the psaltery all the days of my life before the house of God.”"

Let them stand together, and be ashamed and dishonored together.For the craftsman sharpens his iron tool, and fashions the idol with his axe, and pierces it with the awl. He works it with the strength of his arm, and will hunger and grow weak, and will not drink water.The craftsman selects his wood and stretches out his rule, and fits it with glue.

They kindle it, and bake bread for themselves; but he works into gods what is left and worships them.They burn half of it in the fire, and with the other half they bake bread for themselves. They roast meat on it, eat and are satisfied. He even warms himself and says, ‘I am comfortable, because I am warm, and have seen the fire.’ And the rest of it he makes into a carved god, and worships it and prays to it, and says, ‘Deliver me, for you are my god.’ They do not know how to discern because they shut their eyes, so as not to see with their eyes or understand with their heart.No one considered in his heart, neither pondered in his soul, nor knew in his discernment, that he burned half of it in the fire, baked bread on its coals, roasted meat and ate, and then made the rest of it an abomination; and they worship it.Know this: their heart is ashes; they go astray, and no one can deliver his soul.

The Lord is a good judge to the house of Israel, and He deals with us according to His mercy, and according to the multitude of His righteousness.He said, “Surely My people, My children, have not rejected Me?” So He became their salvation.Not an elder or an angel, but the Lord Himself saved them from all their tribulation, because He loved them and spared them. He redeemed and took them up, and lifted them up all the days of old.Yet they disobeyed Him and grieved His Holy Spirit. So He turned against them with hostility and waged war on them.Then He remembered the days of old, He who brought up the shepherd of His sheep from the land. Where is He who put His Holy Spirit in them?Where is He who led Moses with His right hand, the arm of His glory? He overpowered the water by His presence to make for Himself an everlasting name.He brought them through the deep, like a horse through the desert, yet they did not grow weary.Like cattle through the plain, the Spirit came down from the Lord and guided them. Thus You led Your people, to make Yourself a glorious name.",

There shall no longer be heard in her a voice of weeping, nor a voice of crying.There shall not be the untimely death of a child there, nor shall there be an old man who does not fulfill his time. For a young man shall be a hundred years old, but a sinner who dies at a hundred years old shall be cursed.They shall build houses and dwell in them; and they shall plant vineyards and eat their produce.But they shall not build, and others inhabit; and they shall not plant, and others eat. For according to the days of the tree of life, so shall be the days of My people, and the works of their labors shall not grow old.My elect shall not labor in vain, nor shall they bear children to be a curse; for they are a seed blessed by God; and their offspring shall be with them.It shall be, before they cry out, I will listen to them; while they are still speaking, I will say, ‘What is it?’ The wolves and lambs shall feed together, and the lion, like the ox, shall eat chaff; and the serpent, the ground as bread. They shall not injure, neither destroy in My holy mountain,” says the Lord."
