Malachi spoke with his angel face-to-face as to a friend. Malachi was born in Sopha (Supha), of the tribe of Levi, after the return of the captives from Babylon. He prophesied after the consecration of the temple in Jerusalem, 515 BC. He is commemorated on January 3.",
  "date": "500–350 BC, based on the contents of the book.",
  "theme": "Turn from sin, for the day of the Lord is coming. Malachi considers the temple, the priesthood, and true worship as the spiritual foundation not only for the people of his day, but also for the messianic kingdom to come. Even in the midst of a multitude of sins and evildoings, Malachi looked ahead with hope to see a new day dawning when Elijah (that is, John the Baptist) would be sent and the darkness would disappear with the coming of the Christ."
