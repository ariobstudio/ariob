  "author": "The prophet Hosea (commemorated October 17) is traditionally considered the author of this work. He was of the tribe of Issachar and his name means “salvation” or “deliverance.”",
  "date": "Hosea's prophecy occurred about 750 BC, during the reign of Jeroboam II (786–746) and also after that king's death.",
  "theme": "God's love and faithfulness to His people. Hosea's marital experience is used as a parable in the book, illustrated by his faithfulness to his unfaithful wife Gomer. Hosea is also one of the prophets who emphasize the importance of knowing God (6:6) in steadfast love, instead of substituting vain and empty sacrifices and burnt offerings to come into His presence."
