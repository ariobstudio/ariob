  "author": "Jeremiah the prophet",
  "date": "Written during the three months following the destruction of Jerusalem (October, 587 BC) and before Jeremiah was taken captive to Egypt in December of the same year.",
  "theme": "Major Themes—God's judgment of the people's sins and His unfathomable love and sorrow for Israel. This is Jeremiah's personal testimonial and lament over the devastation of Jerusalem and the temple. The prophet maintains there is still hope for repentance and restoration. Consistent with his previous and later messages, here he instructs the suffering Jews not to despise God's punishment but to repent, confessing their sins and seeking forgiveness and deliverance."
