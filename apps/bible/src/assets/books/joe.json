  "author": "Traditionally the prophet Joel (commemorated October 19), son of Pethuel, of the tribe of Reuben. His is a common Jewish name, meaning “Yahweh is God.” Nothing is known of his life outside of his short prophecy.",
  "date": "Any number of dates have been suggested for Joel's life. Fathers such as Ss. Jerome and Isidore place Joel in the time of the prophets Isaiah and Hosea, about 740 BC. Tradition held Joel to be one of the earlier prophets; modern scholars are undecided about the matter, often placing him at about 450–400 BC, after the restoration of Israel from exile.",
  "theme": "Ultimately, the Lord is victorious. Three major themes are prominent. (1) A call summoning the people of God to turn their sorrow into penitence (1:1–2:17). (2) The faithfulness of God to rise up on behalf of His people, restore their prosperity, and bring the nations to justice (2:18–27). (3) The coming of the Holy Spirit, the Third Person of the Trinity (3:1–5). Joel emphasizes the universal mission of the Spirit, anticipating the Day of Pentecost, when He is poured out on all flesh."
