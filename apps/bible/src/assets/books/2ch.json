The importance of proper worship in the temple, particularly the place of the Levites and the musicians, is given special, detailed emphasis. Another theme is the character of each of the kings that followed Solomon—whether they encouraged proper worship of God. The writer ends this book with the tragic account of the destruction of Jerusalem and the seventy-year exile of the Jews to Babylon."
