Esther, an orphan, was chosen by King Xerxes (Ahasuerus) to replace the Persian queen. It was because of her royal position that she was able to persuade the king to save her people. Similar patterns to the rise of Esther as queen may be seen in the rise of Joseph to the court of the Pharaoh and the rise of Daniel in the court of Babylon."
