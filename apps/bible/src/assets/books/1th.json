  "date": "First Thessalonians was written in Corinth in AD 50–51, about six months after the church in Thessalonica was founded. It is probably the first of Paul’s New Testament epistles, and perhaps the first of all the twenty-seven New Testament books to be written.",
  "theme": "A holy life leads to eternal life. Paul calls believers to be holy (3:13; 4:3; 5:23), with particular calls to (a) continue as examples to others (1:7), (b) walk worthy of God’s calling (2:12), (c) stand fast in the faith (3:8), and (d) maintain moral purity (4:3).The letter closes with instruction and comfort concerning the Second Coming of Christ (4:13—5:11), along with other exhortations concerning the spiritual life."
