  "theme": "“The fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom” (9:10). Proverbs is thought to be the foundation for the Beatitudes (Mt 5). In the first nine chapters, the wisdom of God is personified as a companion of God from the beginning and is revealed in the Second Person of the Trinity, Jesus Christ. The personification of wisdom in 8:22–35 is applied to the Theotokos, the Mother of God, in the Church's Divine Liturgy."
