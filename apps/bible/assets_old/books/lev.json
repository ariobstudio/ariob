The word “sacrifice” means to make holy or sacred. These sacrifices and offerings—offered first at the tabernacle and later in the temple—were basically of two types: animal (cattle, sheep, goats, doves) and vegetable (wheat, barley, olive oil, wine, cereal, frankincense). The offerings were types prefiguring a greater reality to be fulfilled in the coming Incarnation of Christ."
