This mystery is so great and wonderful that a man will leave his father and mother with their blessing, and be joined to a woman in marriage.  In this joining, he will be devoted to her with sacrificial love and devotion, and she to him.    This great mystery points to the greater mystery: the marriage of Christ and His Bride, the Church (Eph 5:22–33).

St.  Paul says, “Therefore the law was our tutor to bring us to Christ, that we might be justified by faith.  But after faith has come, we are no longer under a tutor” (Gal 3:24, 25).    Only domesticated animals could be offered to God—animals dependent on the people, who in turn depended on them.

Similarly, in baptism, the worshiper is united with Christ, for Christ's death becomes in the mystery of baptism the very death, burial, and resurrection of the one baptized (Rom 6:3, 4).    In the Levitical liturgy of worship, the burnt offering was accepted as an atonement on behalf of the worshiper.

Apart from Him, no sacrifice is acceptable to God.  This relationship will be seen often throughout Leviticus, and much will be gained by careful observation of Israel's Old Testament service of worship.    A life was given to God and that life was in the blood of the animal offered.  It was acceptable to God as atonement for the offerer.  Its fulfillment is made known in Heb 9:11–22.

Likewise in Leviticus, gifts acceptable to God were carefully prescribed to Israel.    The grain offering of cultivated wheat milled into fine flour was offered as the fruit of the people's labor.  As the animals offered were not wild but domestic, so wild grains were not offered.  The grain offering pictures Christ as the totally acceptable grain offering to God—He who offers all His works as an acceptable offering to the Father.  In Jn 12:24, He says of Himself, “Most assuredly, I say to you, unless a grain of wheat falls into the ground and dies, it remains alone; but if it dies, it produces much grain.” Jesus Himself is the grain of wheat that died and rose again as man's true spiritual food—the living bread that came down out of heaven to give life to the world (Jn 6:41–51).    The grain offering also pictures the faithful of the Church who offer to God for His blessing the works of their hands as co-laborers with Him.  As St.  Paul wrote, “We are God's fellow workers” (1Co 3:9).    Oil added to the flour typifies the work of the Holy Spirit.  Christ offered Himself to the Father through the Holy Spirit (Heb 9:14).  The Holy Spirit also helps us co-labor with God that our labors might be acceptable to Him (Acts 1:8; Eph 5:18).    Frankincense was also added to the various grain offerings.

And thus to this dignity of the high priesthood, which in his opinion surpassed the most honorable position among men, he attached for the sake of honor and glory the name of Christ” (Eusb).    The involuntary sin of some individual may have been detrimental not only to himself but also to others.  This was especially true of a priest who sinned.  “Wishing to show that sins receive more serious punishment by far when they occur in the case of the priest than in the case of the laity, Moses enjoins as great a sacrifice to be offered for the priest as for the whole people, and this amounts to a proof on his part, that the wounds of the priesthood need more assistance, that is, as great as those of all the people together” (JohnChr).

Rather the blood, with its inherent life, is God's gift to mankind to make atonement for sin.  The necessity for atonement was the sacrifice of the innocent life of an animal.    But what was important—lest Israel should become careless about atonement—was not only the blood of the innocent animals sacrificed, but that all animal blood be regarded with respect.  All life was sacred and to be respected.    Of course, this understanding concerning blood in the old covenant was but a type of the blood of Christ, which initiated the new covenant.  On the night of the Last Supper, Jesus said, “This cup is the new covenant in My blood, which is shed for you” (Lk 22:20).

Second, there is the type presented in the matter at hand, to be fulfilled later.  First then, there were the laws regarding unlawful sexual intercourse (uncover nakedness).  The immediate meaning relates to family integrity—the thread on which family members are strung, as jewels, in the relationship of husband and wife as “one flesh” ( ).  The laws set forth here were not arbitrary.  They clearly reflected the essential created character of marriage and family relationships.    Secondly, at least two types are made clear in looking toward the new covenant.  One is that Israel is understood as the wife of God and thus as a type of the Church—as the bride of Christ.  The second is that the earthly husband and wife were also a type of Christ and the Church.  The relationship between Christ and his people is a substantial union—a union of our human nature with His resurrected and glorified human nature.  This is not merely a moral union, a kind of pleasant fellowship with Christ.  Baptism into Christ produces a dynamic union of substance with Him.  This relationship must be guarded and nurtured with the utmost care.  The union must not be corrupted by adding to it that which is foreign.  One cannot have a commitment to union with both God and the world and its attachments, as Christ said: “You cannot serve God and mammon” (Mt 6:24).  Nothing should be introduced into the relationship of oneness that would in any way profane it or make it common."

Rule-keeping was not the end in view; being like God was.    This is also the goal of the new covenant.  However, in the new covenant things are seen more clearly, because Jesus Christ is the supreme definition of holiness.  This huge difference in the understanding of the Law was the source of great conflict between the scribes and Pharisees and Jesus.  He was holy.  They were rule-keepers who had lost the Rule-giver, and thereby lost their holiness.    The expression, “I am the Lord,” “I am the Lord your God,” or “I am the Lord their God,” appears approximately fifty times in Leviticus.  The “I Am” is of critical importance.  It is the absolute foundation of the covenant treaty formula used here.  Everything in the relationship between God and Israel depended on it.  It identified the old covenant Maker.  The “I Am” identified Him uniquely as God.  At the burning bush, the Lord introduced Himself to Moses as the “I Am” (Ex 3:6, 14).    In Jn 8:58, the identity of the Speaker in Leviticus is made known to be Jesus, who says to the Jews, “Most assuredly, I say to you, before Abraham was, I AM.” He is the Son and Word of God, one of the three Persons of the All-Holy Trinity."

The lawyer replied, “‘You shall love the LORD your God with all your heart, with all your soul, with all your strength, and with all your mind,’ and ‘your neighbor as yourself’” (v.  27).

At every Divine Liturgy in the Church, the priest prays a prayer that includes the following words regarding Christ: “For You Yourself are He who offers and is offered, who accepts and is distributed, O Christ our God.” Jesus is not only the perfect priest—as the One who offers—but He is also the perfect sacrifice.  Thus, the rules in Leviticus for qualifications of either priests or animals offered to God are important as types of Christ.    The animals offered were types of Christ as the once-for-all perfect sacrifice.  John the Baptist spoke of Jesus as “the Lamb of God who takes away the sin of the world” (Jn 1:29).  In these Levitical regulations, the people are being tutored ultimately to recognize the Messiah—the Christ—when He would come to be both the offerer and the offered.  The rules also speak to the perfection of the sacrifice of Christ.  He would be perfect and holy—separated to God alone."

It was precisely seven full Sabbaths (forty-nine days) plus one day after Pascha, and marked the completion of the grain harvest.  Here, the offering was not a sheaf of grain, but rather baked loaves, signifying the Church.    Thus, Pentecost also sanctifies the time and life of the Church each year, but not as a sign.  For Christ is the sheaf, the firstfruit.  The loaves are the many from the harvest, those from Christ and in Christ—in the Church.  In Jn 12:24 Jesus said, “Most assuredly, I say to you, unless a grain of wheat falls into the ground and dies, it remains alone; but if it dies, it produces much grain.” This grain is the Church, harvested by the Holy Spirit.  Hence, the ancient Feast of Pentecost prophetically prefigures the birth of the Church through Christ and the Holy Spirit.    At the same time, it also signifies the beginning of the end of the age.  On the Day of Pentecost, fifty days after the Resurrection of Christ, the apostle Peter quoted the prophet Joel to explain what was taking place, “‘It shall come to pass in the last days, says God, / That I will pour out of My Spirit on all flesh’” (Acts 2:17).

Thus an exchange took place in which the Levites became the Lord's liturgical ministers of the tabernacle.  However, the census among the firstborn of the twelve tribes revealed the number of Israel's firstborn sons to be 22,373.  Therefore, a ransom payment was owed to the Lord for this excess number of 373 of Israel's firstborn males.  These males were required to ransom themselves by paying the Levites a redemption tax which totaled 1365 shekels (v.  50).  This redemption tax became a tradition in Israel.  The firstborn males were required to pay this tax in their hometowns.    Jesus' hometown in His adulthood was Capernaum.  So on one occasion in Capernaum, Peter was asked if his teacher paid this tax (Mt 17:24–27).  Peter replied, “Yes.” However, Jesus had no obligation to pay the tax because He is the Son of the King, the heavenly Father, and Jesus, too, is King.  Kings exact tax payments from their subjects, not from their sons.  Nevertheless, to avoid offense, Jesus told Peter to catch a fish, and it would have money in its mouth to pay the tax—not only for Himself, but also for Peter.  For Peter, too, was a firstborn son.  So this tax payment from the mouth of the fish demonstrated Jesus to be the Lord and King over creation and the eternal Son of the heavenly King, the Father (JohnChr).  This also demonstrated it was the Son of God, the King Himself, who ordered the redemption tax to be paid when Israel was in the Wilderness of Sinai."

These Scripture passages are as follows:    Ex 25:40 (also quoted in Heb 8:5): “See to it that you make [all things] according to the pattern shown you on the mountain.” Heb 8:5: “[The priests] serve the copy and shadow of the heavenly things.” Heb 9:23: “Therefore it was necessary that the copies of the things in the heavens should be purified with these.” Heb 9:9: “It was symbolic for the present time in which both gifts and sacrifices are offered.” Heb 9:24: “For Christ has not entered the holy places made with hands, which are copies of the true, but into heaven itself, now to appear in the presence of God for us.” Heb 10:1: “For the law, having a shadow of the good things to come .  .  .” Heb 11:19: “.  .  .  from which [Abraham] also received [Isaac] in a figurative sense.”    The various words therefore are “pattern,” “copy,” “shadow,” “figure,” and “symbol,” all of which carry the same meaning, namely, one level of reality that represents and is fulfilled in another and greater level.

Every work of faith is the action of both God and man, a cooperation (synergy) between the divine and human wills.  This faith and these actions find their source and fulfillment in God-made-Man, Christ.  We experience them through our union with Christ brought about in baptism.    (2) The Holy Spirit gives us power for the ongoing life of righteousness in Christ, the life of blessing (3:1–14).

That is why St.  Athanasius can say, “God became man that man might become god.”    The Father chose us (v.  4) in Him, the Son.  Christ, who is God by nature, became Man by choice.  If we choose Him, we, who are human by nature, become “gods” by grace.  If we are in Christ, the Son of God, we are sons of God.  Paul is not addressing individuals as such but us, the community, the Church.  And he is not addressing the issue of human will in salvation but the will of God, which is that all are chosen (see Rom 11:32; 1Ti 2:4; 2Pt 3:9).  But being predestined (v.  5) by God does not nullify human will: in everything, God is the originator, the initiator; we merely respond, but our response is necessary.

The Lord Jesus Christ is (1) the One who created the universe, together with the Father and the Holy Spirit, and is therefore (2) the One who sustains the Creation and has absolute authority over it.  It is natural, then, that the Son, as both God and Man, is heir of all things (v.  2).  If the sons of Abraham hoped to be heirs of the promised land, the sons of Christ can hope to be heirs of the whole universe.    The first half of v.  3 is quoted verbatim in the Liturgy of St.  Basil the Great.  The brightness of His glory expresses the Son's nature, His origin from and identity of nature with the Father.  He is the Father's brightness because He is begotten from the Father beyond time and without change.  Thus, the Nicene Creed speaks of “Light of Light.” As the sun does not exist without radiating light, so the Father does not exist without His Son.    Thus, the Son reflects His Father's glory in this world.  The unapproachable light of divinity, the divine energy (1Ti 6:16; 1Pt 2:9; 1Jn 1:7), is approachable only in the incarnate Christ (Jn 12:36).  God's brightness, though it had been experienced at the burning bush (Ex 3:2–4), known by Israel (Ex 10:23; 13:21), and spoken of by the prophets (Ps 35:10; 103:2; Is 9:1; 10:17; Hab 3:4), is especially revealed in Christ's birth (Lk 1:79; 2:32; Jn 1:4–9), the Transfiguration (Mt 17:2) and the Resurrection.    The express image of His person (Gr.  hypostasis) expresses the Son's Person as being distinct from the Father.  The Son is the perfect and eternal “icon” of the Father.  Thus, the personal distinction of God as Trinity is known only through Him (see Jn 14:9).

Hence, this sacrament has a double purpose: not only for healing but for forgiveness also.  The presbyter (shortened form: priest) is given certain gifts of the ministry at ordination, the laying on of hands (see 1Ti 4:14).  Prayer is combined with olive oil—not only the primary medicine of ancient times, but also a symbol of the Holy Spirit in the Church—in a single sacrament that effects a healing for the whole person.  Thus, the elements of the sacrament of healing include (1) the presbyter or priest (v.  13); (2) the prayer of (the) faith that will save (v.  15), connected with (3) the work of Christ Himself, for the Lord will raise us up, and (4) the Holy Spirit, manifested in the oil; and (5) confession of sins just prior to the anointing with oil, which explains why James writes if he has committed sins, he will be forgiven (v.  15).  In the Orthodox Church, this sacrament is granted anyone who is sick, whether in danger of dying or not."

When a Christian was guilty of sin, the matter was confessed before the whole Church as an act of repentance.  As the Church grew, and those not part of the community came to observe, the pressure in such public confession became so great that the priest, instead of the entire community, heard the confession, representing the people.  What is not taught in Scripture is a private confession only to God, which refuses to acknowledge sin to the community (1Jn 1:8, 10).  Thus, the Church has effected healing through such works of faith as confession of sins and the power of intercessory prayer."

More beneficial than controlling our tongue in a moment of anger and refraining from angry words is purifying our heart from rancor and not harboring malicious thoughts against our brethren.  The Gospel teaches us to cut off the roots of our sins and not merely their fruits.  When we have dug the root of anger out of our heart, we will no longer act with hatred or envy.  ‘Whoever hates his brother is a murderer’ (3:15), for he kills him with the hatred in his mind.  The blood of a man who has been slain by the sword can be seen by men, but blood shed by the hatred in the mind is seen by God, who rewards each man with punishment or a crown not only for his acts but for his thoughts and intentions as well.  As God Himself says through the Prophet: ‘Behold, I am coming to reward them according to their actions and their thoughts’ [cf.  WSir 11:24]; and the Apostle says: ‘And their thoughts accuse or else excuse them in the day when God shall judge the secrets of men’ [Rom 2:15, 16].  The Lord Himself teaches us to put aside all anger when He says: ‘Whoever is angry with his brother shall be in danger of judgment’ [Mt 5:22].  This is the text of the best manuscripts; for it is clear from the purpose of Scripture in this context that the words ‘without a cause’ were added later.  The Lord's intention is that we should remove the root of anger, its spark, so to speak, in whatever way we can, and not keep even a single pretext for anger in our hearts.  Otherwise we will be stirred to anger initially for what appears to be a good reason and then find that our incensive power is totally out of control” (JohnCas)."

The lesson for us as Christians is to keep walking in our union with Christ.    (2) The proper domain of the angels is in their likeness and proximity to God.  Their own abode is heaven, though they may serve elsewhere.  Those who left their proper place are confined far from God, having become bound to spiritual darkness.  They await the judgment (see 2Pt 2:4), when bonds with God will be demolished forever.  The lesson for Christians is that their proper domain is in being children of God by grace, and their own abode is in the one holy Church.    (3) The men in the plains around Sodom and Gomorrah lusted after angels because of their sin of immorality and homosexuality (Gn 19:1–29).

For the church in Sardis had so completely compromised with the surrounding pagan world that although it appeared to be alive, it was spiritually dead (Mt 21:19).  There is irony in Christ's accusation.  Sardis boasted of a venerable temple to the Asiatic mother-goddess Cybele, purportedly able to restore the dead to life.  In the letter to Ephesus (2:1–7), the seven stars represented the angels that guided the churches.  The seven Spirits of God is either an expression indicating the fullness of God's powerful presence in the Church, or an allusion to the sevenfold operation of the Spirit of God spoken of by Isaiah (11:2), a connection proposed by St.  Justin.

The holy city (v.  2) shows the setting to be Jerusalem.  The Synoptic Gospels also taught that Jerusalem would fall (Mt 24; Mk 13; Lk 21); Luke mentioned specifically that the Gentiles would trample Jerusalem for a period (21:24).  In patristic tradition the second interpretation is preferable.  The court outside (v.  2) is for both Jews and Gentiles.  It will not be measured because of the large number of Christians.    The forty-two months (v.  2) is three and a half years, one-half of seven, symbolizing what is not full or final but temporary, incomplete.  It derives from Daniel's “a time, two times, and half a time” (12:7), the three-and-a-half-year period when the temple was to be profaned (Dan 9:27).  John affirms the true temple, the Church, will be preserved during this Gentile onslaught.  “Temple” is a frequent NT symbol for the Church (1Co 3:16, 17; 2Co 6:16; Eph 2:19–22)."

John may be purposefully enigmatic, using a secret code to protect against a charge of sedition.    This is a predictably misunderstood passage, for the text itself says it requires wisdom and understanding. In the Bible, the number six stands for falling short, incompleteness, imperfection; seven, for perfection, fullness, completion; eight, for eschatological perfection, a superabundance of fullness (see 2En 33:1).  The sixth day, Friday, is the day of preparation; the seventh, the Sabbath, Saturday, a picture of the rest to come; the eighth day, Sunday, the day of the Resurrection, the final establishment of God's Kingdom.

If John were referring to Domitian, whom some considered to be Nero reincarnated, it would be safer to refer not to the present persecutor but to the one long gone.

In apocalyptic literature, numbers have symbolic significance.  “Thousand” is often used in the Scriptures to denote a long period of time, a great quantity, completion, perfection, thoroughness (Job 9:3; 2Pt 3:8).  Here, a thousand years (vv.  2–7) is interpreted as the Church age, when Jesus reigns on earth in those who believe.  It is that era between the first and second comings of Christ, also called the “last times,” when Satan's effectiveness at deceit is restricted through the Cross and Resurrection of Christ, and the saints share in Christ's earthly reign through the Church.

And the number seven was regulated according to the divisions of time established at Creation (Gn 1–11)—into days, weeks, months, years, and periods of years.    Thus, the liturgical worship ascended from (1) the daily offerings (Ex 29:38–42; Nm 28:3–8), to (2) the weekly offerings (Ex 20:8–11; Lv 23:3; Nm 28:9, 10), to (3) the monthly offerings (Nm 28:11–15), to (4) the yearly offerings (Ex 12:1–20; 23:15, 16; 34:22; Lv 16:1–34; 23:1–44; Nm 28:16–29:38), to (5) the sabbatical year (Ex 23:10, 11; Lv 25:1–7), and eventually to (6) the Year of Remission (Lv 25:8–55; 27:17–25).    Israel's liturgical worship was designed to sanctify time and all life.

This covetous spirit eventually led them into idolatry and into captivity in Assyria (1Ch 5:25, 26).    A man from the crowd asked Jesus to make his brother divide the inheritance with him, but Jesus declined, because He did not come to be a judge or arbitrator like Moses.

He defends this view by citing the impassible chasm in the Lazarus parable (Lk 16:26).  The apparition appeared only to the woman; she told Saul whom it resembled.

The Church, then, is to follow His example: His behavior in relation to the ungodly (v.  1); His zeal for the truth (v.  2); and His holy and virtuous life (v.  3)."

First, it shows that sin or evil is an action of man's free will (says within himself, v.  2; acts deceitfully, lest He discover, v.  3; is unwilling, v.  4; devises, sets himself, and does not abhor, v.  5).  Therefore, sin or evil is not a part of human essence or nature, for God created human nature good in itself.  Sinning is altogether the wrong use of free will, and the most dangerous wrong use is arrogance, which often comes against the saints (v.  12).  But such a wrong use ultimately brings down the lawless (fall there and unable to stand, v.  13).    Second, this psalm reveals the proper use of free will, which is to seek out and hope (v.  8) for God's mercy (vv.  6, 11), His truth (v.  6), His righteousness (vv.  7, 11), and His judgments (v.  7).  Also with free will, the upright in heart (v.  11) may be intoxicated by drinking the abundant water (v.  9) that flows from the fountain and by seeing the light which is in light (v.  10).  The fountain is the Father, and the Son is the water, the light, and the life that goes forth from this fountain.  Those who willingly drink of this water in baptism, and who see this light, partake of life and light (see also Jn 1:4), and also become intoxicated with the Holy Spirit (the fatness, v.  9; see also Jn 7:37–39; Acts 2:13–17; Eph 5:18)."

The early Desert Fathers used v.  2 as a text of ceaseless prayer (O God, make haste to help me, v.  2), thereby living out the exhortation of St.  Paul in 1Th 5:17 to “pray without ceasing.” Also, this prayer, “O God, make haste to help me,” is often seen as the precursor to the Jesus Prayer: “O Lord Jesus Christ, Son of God, have mercy on me a sinner.” Verses 3–6 show some results of receiving God's help."

Such a son will regret hating the instruction and reproofs of Wisdom (vv.  12, 13).

Impassibility, however, does not mean that God does not care.  His wrath shows that He cares deeply.  God loves His creation perfectly.

It may sound strange to modern ears to hear God speak of His holy jealousy, yet what husband would not be jealous in a positive sense for his wife?  One would question a husband's love for his wife if he did not care whom she had conjugal relations with, spent time with, gave money to, or heaped devotion upon.  Love does not preclude a zeal for the beloved or a protective, positive, proper jealousy.  God is jealous for His people against all falsehood that destroys His creation.    The source of God's jealousy here is the foul way the enemies of the Jews treated them in the exile.  God was angry with His people and directed these nations against Judah as divine punishment.  These enemies, however, went farther than God intended.  God uses evil for good and evil men for good purposes, but this does not excuse the evil or ascribe divine authorship to it.  The wrath of God against His people does not justify the violence and wickedness of those who are instruments of it."

The fact that we are not murderers of millions does not make us safe.  The standard of God's judgment is whether we worship Him in Spirit and in truth (Jn 4:21–24).    Zechariah concludes with a condemnation of Egypt and all nations that do not come to Jerusalem to celebrate the Feast of Tabernacles (also called the Feast of Booths; see Lv 23:33–36).  This feast was associated with covenant renewal and the deliverance of Israel.  Christ is the eternal Word of God who, in the Incarnation, “dwelt [or tabernacled] among us” (Jn 1:14).

The silver chest and arms (v.  32) represent the 245-year supremacy of the Medo-Persians, beginning with Cyrus in 539 BC.  The stomach and thighs of copper (v.  32) represent Alexander the Great and his Greek empire, established about 330 BC.  Next came the brutal Roman Empire, represented by the legs of iron (v.  33).  According to Hippolytus, the feet of iron and clay (v.  33) correspond with the “ten horns” in Daniel's vision, and represent ten nations after Rome (see 7:8, 24, 25 and note).

First, the Jews would return and resume sacrifice after seventy years of captivity.  “Having mentioned therefore seventy weeks, and having divided them into two parts, in order that what was spoken by him to the prophet might be better understood, he proceeds thus, until Messiah the Prince there shall be seven weeks, which make forty-nine years.  It was in the twenty-first year [of Nebuchadnezzar's reign] that Daniel saw these things in Babylon.

The Kingdom is often portrayed as a marriage (see 22:1–14 and note) between Christ and His Church.  The marriage will be consummated at the end of the age when the Bridegroom returns to escort His Bride—the Church—into the eternal wedding banquet.    This parable is primarily about the virtue of charity and almsgiving, as oil and “mercy” have the same root in Greek.  The wise virgins are those who practice charity and mercy in this life, while the foolish are those who squander God's gifts on themselves.    The fact that all the virgins slumbered and slept indicates death: in this world the virtuous will die alongside the wicked.  The cry at midnight indicates the Second Coming, when the wicked will arise with the righteous for judgment.  The inability of the righteous to share their oil is not to be interpreted as a lack of generosity.  Rather, it is an illustration of (1) the impossibility of entering heaven without one's own faith and virtue, and (2) the impossibility of changing one's state of virtue after death (see Lk 16:26).    The themes of this parable and the one before it (24:45–51) are woven together in the liturgical hymns of Holy Week, particularly in the troparion hymn for Holy Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday, which begins, “Behold, the Bridegroom comes at midnight, and blessed is the servant whom He shall find watching.”"

Burying the talent in the ground (v.  18) is an illustration of using one's God-given gifts for earthly pursuits.

The word Passover refers to the angel of death “passing over” Hebrew homes when killing the firstborn of the Egyptians, for the Jews had put lamb's blood on their doorposts (Ex 12:13).  Unleavened bread is a reminder of the haste with which the Hebrews left Egypt (Ex 12:39).  This Passover was fulfilled in Christ, whose blood was shed to free humanity from bondage to sin and death."

Fasting is useful and necessary, but it depends on our choice, while the law of God demands charity.  Thus receiving Christ in you, I serve you with all diligence, and when I have taken leave of you, I resume the rule of fasting again.” In this way the ascetics would obey Christ's command here and His command that we not “appear to men to be fasting” (Mt 6:18; see also Rom 14:2–6; 1Co 10:27; Heb 13:2)."

This parallels the creation of light on the first day in Gn 1:3–5.    (2) The second day (1:29–34)—John the Baptist declares that Christ baptizes with the Holy Spirit, which is greater than his own baptism of repentance, performed with water on earth.  This parallels the separation of water above from the water below on the second day in Gn 1:6–8.    (3) The third day (1:35–42)—John the Baptist sends two disciples to Christ whom Christ gathers to be His own, one of whom He declares to be the foundation of the Church (v.  42; see Mt 16:18).  This parallels the gathering of the waters and the establishment of growth on the land on the third day in Gn 1:9–13.    (4) The fourth day (1:43–51)—Jesus calls Philip and Nathanael, who see Christ as the true Light, the One who was revealed in the OT, a lesser light.  This parallels the establishment of the lesser and greater lights governing the night and the day respectively on the fourth day in Gn 1:14–19.    (5) The sixth day (2:1–11)—John does not include the events of the fifth day, but jumps to the sixth.  The phrase on the third day is an expression meaning “two days later,” for it includes the current day in the calculation (see 2:1 and note).  On this sixth day, the wedding in Cana occurs, which parallels the creation of man and woman in Gn 1:26–31.    (6) The seventh day (2:12)—Jesus rests at Capernaum with His mother, His brothers, and His disciples, which parallels God resting on the seventh day in Gn 2:1–3."

John uses the term signs to show that these miraculous actions point beyond themselves to the truth that the Kingdom of God has come among us in the Person of Jesus Christ.  The seven signs are (1) changing water into wine (2:1–11); (2) curing the nobleman's son (4:46–54); (3) healing the paralytic (5:1–15); (4) feeding the five thousand (6:1–14); (5) walking on water (6:15–21); (6) opening the eyes of a blind man (9:1–41); and (7) raising Lazarus from the dead (11:38–44).    The setting here is significant.  In the OT, marriage feasts symbolized the union of God with His Bride, Israel.  Jesus begins His ministry at Galilee, which had a large Gentile population; this was a sign of the spread of the gospel to all the world.  That this wedding took place on the third day sets a resurrectional tone, showing that the marriage of God and His Church will be fulfilled in Christ's Resurrection.  Other parallels between the marriage here and the Resurrection account in 20:1–18 are that both involve a woman named Mary who makes an appeal, and in both passages the disciples are invited to witness the event.  Furthermore, the Resurrection account (20:11–18) has a striking similarity to SS 3:1–5, again showing the unity between marriage and our Lord's Resurrection.    By His presence at this wedding, Jesus further declares marriage to be holy and honorable (Heb 13:4); therefore, this passage is read at Orthodox weddings, and these images are incorporated into many prayers in the wedding service."

That Christ fulfills Mary's request teaches several things: (1) Christ is Lord over hours and seasons and is not subject to them.  (2) The wedding party needed to be aware of their lack of wine first so that they might learn that it is Christ who fulfills all needs.

In this passage, the multitudes follow Christ because of His signs (v.  2), and this too takes place at Passover (v.  4).    (2) In the Exodus, the Jews were said to eat unleavened bread because they were hastily driven out of Egypt and had brought no provisions for themselves (Ex 12:39).  Here, Jesus feeds the multitudes with earthly bread because they had brought no provisions, having rushed out to see Him (vv.  2–14).    (3) In the Exodus, Moses leads the people across the Red Sea, walking on dry ground in the midst of the water (Ex 14:15–31).  Here, Christ sends His disciples across the sea (v.  17) and then walks on the sea (v.  19) as if it were dry ground.    (4) In the Exodus, God fed His people manna and gave them drink from a miraculous water source (Ex 16:1–17:7).  Here, Christ declares Himself to be the true food and drink, the true bread that has come down from heaven (vv.  48–58).    These parallels show that Christ our God is the fulfillment of the old covenant, and that the breaking of His body and the shedding of His blood, which free mankind from the slavery of sin, fulfill the sacrifice of the Passover lambs (1:29), which brought the people out of slavery into the Promised Land."

It is new life: our reconciliation to God (vv.  18–20) and our becoming new creatures (v.  17), participants in the very righteousness of God (v.  21).  This means our salvation is not just juridical (the static, legal pronouncement of a judge), but personal and relational (the dynamic, sacrificial love of a father for his child)."

Titus is to make sure they actually have begun to do so (8:6).  Paul has told the Macedonians that Corinth was exemplary in giving (9:2), but he has his doubts.  So he sends Titus to Corinth to be sure the Corinthians will comply (9:3–5).  Some in Corinth feel pressure, saying that Paul is “crafty”; he gets his way “by cunning” (12:16).

God owes no one anything—He certainly does not owe us salvation.    Whereas the Son is God by nature, we become sons of God by adoption.  We cannot become members of the Godhead by nature because we are human by nature.  But we do become members of His family by grace.  In adoption we become everything God is, except that we do not share His nature.  Because we are given new life, adoption is also called a new birth, being born again."
